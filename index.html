        <h2>Understanding Global Warming and Carbon Footprint</h2>
        <p>Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's climate system, primarily due to human activities. The release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), contributes to the greenhouse effect, trapping heat and causing the Earth's average temperature to rise.</p>
        
        <p>One way to measure your impact on global warming is by calculating your carbon footprint. It represents the total amount of greenhouse gases, measured in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), that you contribute to the atmosphere through activities like energy consumption, transportation, and more.</p>

        <h2>Trivia</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>2023 was the hottest year on record.</p>
            <p>Global sea levels rose about 20 centimetres in the last century. However, the rate in the last two decades is nearly double that of the last century and is accelerating every year.</p>
            <p> More than 1 million species face extinction.</p>
            <p>We use more of the earth's resources than it can renew</p>
            <p>Scientists have estimated that up to 90% of coral reefs worldwide are at risk of being completely wiped out by 2050.</p>
            <p>20% of all global green house gas emissions caused by humans are due to deforestation.</p>
            <p>People supply additional amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, but these amounts are still relatively small compared to what is produced through natural processes.</p>
            <p>Increased CO2 in the atmosphere has both warming and cooling effects across the world, thus making future climate changes still difficult to predict with any accuracy.</p>
            <p>Scaling up natural climate solutions, such as restoring degraded forests, could create as many as 20 million new jobs.</p>
